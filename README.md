### :space_invader: Lets'GAVEL!!!

## 🙌 Why working at Gavel

Gavel is a live shopping marketplace for retailers in the EU, starting with comic stores. We allow shop owners to turn their offline store into a live and interactive online store within a few seconds. With our passion for technology, we build the best platform to connect, buy and sell with and from each other.

👉 Check out our app on the [Apple App Store](http://letsgavel.com/ios) and [Google Play Store](http://letsgavel.com/android).
</aside>

Being part of GAVEL is more than a job — it's a journey. It is working in a fast-growing startup with a fundamental impact on e-commerce. Regular online stores don't cut it anymore. Being community- and data-driven is what defines our DNA 🤩

We are backed by the world's most prestigious and well-known VCs and Business Angels. We grow fast and will grow even faster together with you!

**This is your chance to be part of something big from the beginning. So roll up your sleeves and get involved 💪**

## 🌍 Join GAVEL from around the world

We are a Berlin-based and globally distributed team of live streaming enthusiasts and we are looking for you!

## Our Culture

> *"Working with such a focused and tech-savvy team really encourages you to make the world a better place and help society discover new technology!"*
> 


👐 **Structure & Transparency**
- No false promises. We offer you a long-term career path and want to grow the company together with you. You will get a lot of insights.

🔥 **Exciting Technology**
- At Gavel we focus on cutting-edge things, like live-streaming, bidding in real-time auctions, a lot of data analysis, and even computer vision.

🙏 **Belonging & Flexibility**
- We value your inputs and the energy you give to Gavel. We want to foster trust by giving you flexibility in how and where you work.

🌍 **Async Working**
- We want to use the benefits of our digital world, to be faster than everyone else. We love the remote and asynchronous way of working.


## Our Core Values


⚙ **Automate tasks**
We avoid repetitive tasks and "think" automated.

🚧 **80:20**
We ship fast and focus on added value.

🎯 **ZDF* / Data-driven**
Numbers, data, and facts are the real thing.


## The Idea

Europe has a unique and rich culture, and tremendous diversity, and people are super open-minded. BUT shop owners here are not tech-savvy at all and sadly very old-fashioned sellers. GAVEL is here to change that. Long-live live shopping 🔥

🤩 **GAVEL brings the people factor back to online shopping**


🥰 **GAVEL truly connects
like-minded collectors**

We empower enthusiasts to host their own shows and turn their hobby into a real business. We start with trading cards, but there is a broad variety of collectibles ahead.
