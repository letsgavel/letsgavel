### :space_invader: Lets'GAVEL!!!

## 🙌 Why working at Gavel

Gavel is a live shopping marketplace for retailers in the EU, starting with comic stores. We allow shop owners to turn their offline store into a live and interactive online store within a few seconds. With our passion for technology, we build the best platform to connect, buy and sell with and from each other.

👉 Check out our app on the [Apple App Store](http://letsgavel.com/ios) and [Google Play Store](http://letsgavel.com/android).
</aside>

Being part of GAVEL is more than a job — it's a journey. It is working in a fast-growing startup with a fundamental impact on e-commerce. Regular online stores don't cut it anymore. Being community- and data-driven is what defines our DNA 🤩

We are backed by the world's most prestigious and well-known VCs and Business Angels. We grow fast and will grow even faster together with you!

**This is your chance to be part of something big from the beginning. So roll up your sleeves and get involved 💪**

## 🌍 Join GAVEL from around the world

We are a Berlin-based and globally distributed team of live streaming enthusiasts and we are looking for you!

## Our Culture

> *"Working with such a focused and tech-savvy team really encourages you to make the world a better place and help society discover new technology!"*
> 


👐 **Structure & Transparency**
- No false promises. We offer you a long-term career path and want to grow the company together with you. You will get a lot of insights.

🔥 **Exciting Technology**
- At Gavel we focus on cutting-edge things, like live-streaming, bidding in real-time auctions, a lot of data analysis, and even computer vision.

🙏 **Belonging & Flexibility**
- We value your inputs and the energy you give to Gavel. We want to foster trust by giving you flexibility in how and where you work.

🌍 **Async Working**
- We want to use the benefits of our digital world, to be faster than everyone else. We love the remote and asynchronous way of working.


## Our Core Values


⚙ **Automate tasks**
We avoid repetitive tasks and "think" automated.

🚧 **80:20**
We ship fast and focus on added value.

🎯 **ZDF* / Data-driven**
Numbers, data, and facts are the real thing.


## The Idea

Europe has a unique and rich culture, and tremendous diversity, and people are super open-minded. BUT shop owners here are not tech-savvy at all and sadly very old-fashioned sellers. GAVEL is here to change that. Long-live live shopping 🔥

🤩 **GAVEL brings the people factor back to online shopping**


🥰 **GAVEL truly connects
like-minded collectors**

We empower enthusiasts to host their own shows and turn their hobby into a real business. We start with trading cards, but there is a broad variety of collectibles ahead.

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/452/javascript--v1.png" alt="https://img.icons8.com/ios/452/javascript--v1.png" width="40px" /> **Javascript-driven**
We use JS along with the whole stack: Node, Express, ReactNative. We virtualize our API with Docker behind an NGINX and deploy it automated. We code sustainably, use Typescript, and foster test-driven development. We try to understand Javascript execution deeply.


<img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/socket-io.svg" alt="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/socket-io.svg" width="40px" /> **Experience-driven**
We use a bunch of APIs, services, and modules to create the unique live-streaming and real-time shopping experience, Gavel stands for. We constantly refactor and optimize our code to keep it smooth and performant. Our user journey is shaped by simplicity.


**Data-driven**
We are constantly prototyping, as we develop new features only if they bring added value to our users. We analyze behavioral data to prove that our users like it. We use computer vision and recommendation algorithms to make the UX as catchy and simple as possible.
